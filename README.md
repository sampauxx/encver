# encver
A self-hosted code versioning tool for anonymous development

## About the project
First developed by nao.importa.web@xmpp.jp, the original project name was **cver** (Crypto VERsion). As the project doesn't have his own repository, I decided to create my own based on the first code and, to avoid correlation with Crypto Currencies, renamed it as **encver** (ENCrypted VERsioning, or even ENcrypted Code VERsioning).

As the name implies, **encver** is a tool designed to help developers with code versioning, especially those who are concerned about privacy and anonymity. Since you are in control of the server, you can really trust on what happens with your data, because you can trust yourself.

### Should I use encver instead of git and github?
There was a tool called CrimeFlare on github whose purpose was to find out the real ip address behind websites protected by CloudFlare. Due to it, github has disabled this repository. Is the purpose of your code to break some rules or bypass something? Do you care about privacy and anonymity? Do you wanna know for sure what happens on the other side? If "no" is the answer, encver will not meet your demand.
